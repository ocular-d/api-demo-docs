# Overview

This API is organized around REST.

Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses,
and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Petstore API in test mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with the pets.
The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.

The Petstore API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality.

Log in to see docs customized to your version of the API, with your test key and data.
